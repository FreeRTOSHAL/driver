 * This attribute, attached to struct or union type definition, specifies that each member (other than zero-width bit-fields) of the structure or union is placed to minimize the memory required. When attached to an enum definition, it indicates that the smallest integral type should be used.
 * 
 * Specifying the packed attribute for struct and union types is equivalent to specifying the packed attribute on each of the structure or union members. Specifying the -fshort-enums flag on the command line is equivalent to specifying the packed attribute on all enum definitions.
 * 
 * In the following example struct my_packed_struct's members are packed closely together, but the internal layout of its s member is not packedâ€”to do that, struct my_unpacked_struct needs to be packed too.

 * struct my_unpacked_struct {
